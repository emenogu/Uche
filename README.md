What a wonderful World
It's great being on planet earth.
Those guys at LG  must be Prophets to have coined  the phrase 'Life's Good'
Life's Good because of places like GutHub
Life's Good because of the great opportunities made available at my desktop
Life's GGood because of the great possibilities that abound being a programmer
...for me, if you can think it, you can create it; if you can dream it, you can live it.
